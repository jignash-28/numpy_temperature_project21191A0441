# 🌡️ NumPy Temperature Simulation Project

This mini project simulates 30 days of temperature data using NumPy and visualizes it with Matplotlib.

## 📌 What It Does

- Generates daily temperatures using `np.random.normal()` with a mean of 32°C and standard deviation of 3°C.
- Visualizes the data in a line graph using Matplotlib.
- Demonstrates basic data simulation and visualization skills using Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Output

A line chart showing simulated temperature variation over 30 days.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python numpy_temperature_project.py
   ```
